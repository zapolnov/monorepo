= monorepo for cppfw libraries

**cppfw** libraries repositories are added as submodules under the `repos/` directory.
The submodules are configured to `latest` remote branch. So updating the submodules with:
```
git submodule update --remote --init
```
Will always sync to latest release versions of the libraries.

== Building with CMake

First, make sure you have the link:https://vcpkg.io[VCPKG] installed and `VCPKG_ROOT` environment variable set accordingly.

Then:
```
cd build/cmake
cmake .
cmake --build . --parallel
```

Test applications binaries will be put to `build/cmake/out` directory.

On Windows one can use the provided command scripts:

* `msvc2022_gen.cmd` - fetches submodules, installs vcpkg and generates Microsoft Visual Studio 2022 project
* `msvc2022_build.cmd` - generates Microsoft Visual Studio 2022 project and builds Release target
* `msvc2022_open.cmd` - generates Microsoft Visual Studio 2022 and opens it in the IDE
